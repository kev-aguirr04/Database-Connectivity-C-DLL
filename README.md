# Database-Connectivity-C-DLL

This repository's main purpose is to allow developers to connect to a database using a C# DLL that they can reference when developing an application. 

This allows for quick development where you focus mainly on your main app's code instead of writing functions to connect and retrieve
data from a database.

Add a reference and a using statement to use the code in your application.
